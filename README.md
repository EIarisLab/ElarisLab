## üß† AI Functionality

Elaris Lab is powered by five core AI modules. Each one targets a specific domain ‚Äî from innovation tracking to security analysis ‚Äî creating a full-spectrum research and risk intelligence system for modern blockchains.

### 1. üîß TechForge ‚Äî Blockchain Innovation Engine

```javascript
function techForge(blockchainData) {
  const techScore = blockchainData.newTechScore * Math.pow(blockchainData.reliability, 0.5);
  const innovationThreshold = 0.7;

  if (techScore > innovationThreshold) {
    return 'Alert: New Blockchain Innovation Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Blockchain Technology Stable';
  }
}
```
#### What it does:
Evaluates technological change by factoring in new feature adoption and network reliability. Flags innovation surges such as major protocol upgrades or forks ‚Äî essential for staying ahead of tech curves.

### 2. üõ°Ô∏è SecureCore ‚Äî AI-Driven Protocol Safeguard

```python
def secure_core(security_rating, protocol_strength):
    vulnerability_index = (security_rating ** 2) * protocol_strength
    security_threshold = 0.8

    if vulnerability_index < security_threshold:
        return 'Alert: Security Protocol Optimization Needed'
    else:
        return 'Security Protocol Strong'
```
#### What it does:
Assesses smart contract and protocol resilience. Flags vulnerable architectures using a weighted scoring model. Helps identify weak security designs before they‚Äôre exploited.

### 3. ‚è± RealTimeSync ‚Äî Blockchain Timestamp Validator

```javascript
function realTimeSync(transactionData) {
  const syncDeviation = Math.abs(transactionData.timestamp - Date.now());
  const maxAllowedDeviation = 2000; // in milliseconds

  if (syncDeviation > maxAllowedDeviation) {
    return 'Alert: Blockchain Sync Deviation Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Blockchain Sync Accurate';
  }
}
```
#### What it does:
Detects timing issues in blockchain event recording. Highlights latency, chain reorg risks, and oracle sync faults ‚Äî vital for time-critical dApps and automation flows.

### 4. üîÆ FutureGuard ‚Äî Forecasting Blockchain Risk

```python
def future_guard(tech_age, market_stability_factor):
    future_risk = (tech_age * market_stability_factor) / 100

    if future_risk > 0.6:
        return 'Alert: Future Blockchain Risk Detected'
    else:
        return 'Blockchain Future-Proof'
```
#### What it does:
Predicts long-term chain fragility by combining protocol age and market volatility. Alerts if a network shows signs of obsolescence or economic instability.

### 5. üß¨ DataShield ‚Äî Real-Time Data Integrity Monitor

```javascript
function dataShield(dataIntegrity) {
  const dataIntegrityScore = dataIntegrity * Math.pow(dataIntegrity, 0.5);
  const integrityThreshold = 0.95;

  if (dataIntegrityScore < integrityThreshold) {
    return 'Alert: Data Integrity Issue Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Data Integrity Secure';
  }
}
```
#### What it does:
Validates the integrity of real-time blockchain data ‚Äî including payloads and state transitions. Detects corruption, loss, or manipulation before damage propagates across systems.

#### These modules form the brain of Elaris Lab ‚Äî a predictive, adaptive AI that transforms raw chain noise into structured knowledge and forward alerts.
